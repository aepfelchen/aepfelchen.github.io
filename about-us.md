### Maike Park

I am a research assistant and lecturer at the university of Passau, currently working towards obtaining a PhD. Among other things, I have also taught German as a foreign language abroad and worked as a lexicographer for a dictionary of neologisms. My recent research focuses on methodical approaches to investigate metaphorical constructions from a cognitive perspective.

You can find details on my research here: [GRK2700 - C4](https://www.uni-marburg.de/en/fb09/grk-2700/projects/c4-polysemy-and-metaphors-as-a-challenge-for-mental-representations) and an overview over things I've been doing up until now here: [University of Passau](https://www.geku.uni-passau.de/deutsche-sprachwissenschaft/lehrstuhlteam/maike-park)
