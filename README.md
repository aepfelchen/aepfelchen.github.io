## Parks' Lab

This blog plans to record and post various research results in the future.

### Gwanghun Park

I received my bachelor's and master's degrees in German Language and Literature at the Pusan ​​National University and recently completed my second master's degree in Cultural Data Studies at the Philipps University of Marburg. My recent areas of interest are network theory and quantitative analysis of texts.

### Maike Park

I am a research assistant and lecturer at the university of Passau, currently working towards obtaining a PhD. Among other things, I have also taught German as a foreign language abroad and worked as a lexicographer for a dictionary of neologisms. My recent research focuses on methodical approaches to investigate metaphorical constructions from a cognitive perspective.
