## Master's Thesis of Gwanghun Park

**Stylometric analysis of the correlation between letter and gender around 1800 using the example of the edition of August Wilhelm Schlegelâ€™s correspondence**

Abstract

In this master's thesis, I use correspondences of August Wilhelm Schlegel, an early romanticist from the 18th century, as a text corpus to compare women's writing with men's writing in the social and cultural context of the time. For this research purpose, linguistic and computer-based methodologies are used. To compare female and male subcorpora comprised of letters, quantitative and qualitative analyses were conducted in regard to various linguistic areas such as vocabulary, grammar, syntax, semantics, and pragmatics.
